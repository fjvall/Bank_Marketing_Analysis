# Bank_Marketing_Analysis
The main objective of this project is to predict if clients will subscribe to a bank deposit term through a direct marketing campaign. The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebooks to obtain an exhaustive visualization exploratory analysis and run the Machine Learning models. In terms of the data preprocessing, a resampling method was used given the imbalanced characteristics of the output variable. Only one in ten customers who were contacted, subscribed. The following models were applied:  logistic regression, lasso logistic regression, k-NN and random forest. The best model for predictions was Random Forest. The most important factors for campaign success were related to economic conditions, which included the variables emp.var.rate, euribor3m, cons.conf.idx and cons.price.idx.
